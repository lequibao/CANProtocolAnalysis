Protocol Analysis
This software can achieve the parsing of the communication protocol between non-vehicular conductive chargers and battery management systems for electric vehicles, as specified in GBT 27930-2015. It is currently widely used for laboratory testing of DC charging stations and on-site issue troubleshooting. Customers have provided feedback indicating stable software operation, a noticeable improvement in testing efficiency, and assistance in reducing on-site issue troubleshooting time for after-sales personnel.

(The Python file for interface testing of protocol parsing needs to be used with Python version 3.6, while other Python files can be used with Python version 3.7.)

This project is a fork and translation to the English Language
